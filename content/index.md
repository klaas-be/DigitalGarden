Hello! It looks like you found my [[Mind gardening|Digital Garden]].

These are my work-in-progress notes on topics I'm generally interested in. Not all the notes are in their final stage, and this is my place to [[Learning in public|learn in public]]. So if you find anything interesting, have something to share, or want to contribute, write a comment and let me know.
